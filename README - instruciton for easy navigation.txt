1. check the 'data_frame_extraction.py' where in the *main* there are
commented functions that were used in creation of the data and for
visualising some of the data

2. check the 'classification.py' *main* where the commented functions
are sorted in the order that they were used for the paper, just uncomment
the ones you'd like to check

Thank you
